Thank you for downloading a copy of Zork, The PY Edition!
This Python Program is based loosely on the Storyline of Zork I, and is intended to run and function exactly like the original -
the only difference being that this version is written with Python and can therefore be run and downloaded for free!

To get started:

1. If you do not have the latest version of Python 3 installed, please install it from http://www.python.org/download
1. Open the file named "zork.py"
1. Have Fun!

**Note: This program is built to run on Python 3.**

Custom Room Notes:

The custom room is the clearing in which the ogre was initially discovered.  However, rather than just running away from the ogre, you now have options.

The options that produce an output include:
1. Kill Ogre - you are never given any items to kill the ogre and so instead the ogre eats you.
2. Befriend Ogre - If you do not have a fish in your inventory you cannot befriend the ogre and the ogre eats you.  In order to acquire a fish, you must say fish four times while at the lake.  
Additionally, the fishing rod is no longer at the pier, it has to be retrieved from the attic.
By befriending the ogre by giving it the fish, you get the key that opens the trunk at the end of the game. Automatically returns to previous room.
3. Escape/Go North - returns you to the previous room.
